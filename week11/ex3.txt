Using fork() in our program leads to the fact that parent and child processes have the same buffers.

Program 1:
Before fork(), we have "Hello" in buffer. Then, after printf("\n"), \n is added to the buffer for each process. That is why in output we have:
Hello
Hello


Program 2:
Before fork(), we have "Hello\n" in buffer. Then, after printf("\n"), \n is added to the buffer for each process. That is why in output we have:
Hello

Hello
